\section{Research questions}
\label{sec:researchquestions}

Symbolic execution/analysis does result in optimal attack synthesis among other advantages, it is due to all possible paths are modelled into constraints and then analysed.
However, the obvious challenge is that the state space increases exponentially.
Different tools employ different techniques to overcome this well know challenge, now the question here is \emph{What does Klee do differently?}
In the literature XXX add paper, Symbolic Path Finder is a java based symbolic tool was used to analyze the adaptive side channel attack and quantify information leakage.
The SPF implementation of this problem timeout for larger domains and k (XXX add more accurate data) and they employed heuristics to explore some set states to achieve better scalability (to some extent).

In this project, we want to investigate if \texttt{Klee} employ any specific techniques for scalability.
There are several heuristics for exploring the search space and solver chains that can be used.

\section{Experimentation setup and Analysis}
\label{sec:experimentationanddesign}

To invesigate the scalability of adaptive side channel attacks in \texttt{Klee}, we first model a side channel attack and investigate the adaptive $k$-step attack in \texttt{Klee}.

\subsection{Modelling the adaptive symbolic side channel attack}
\label{subsec:modellingsscattack}

We consider a simple side channel attack via symbolic execution.
Consider the code snippet provided below:
\begin{verbatim}
int vulnerable_code(int public_input) {

if (secret >= public_input) { return 1; } // Cost is 1
else { return 2; } // Cost is 2

}
\end{verbatim}

As in any side channel attack, we need difference in some measurement (for example time) here we simply provide the cost as integer
for comparision between different paths.

Now the idea is to apply $k$-step attack, such that we extract some information on secret key.
For example, let $\{1 \dots 6\}$ be the domain of the secret (which we assume to know) and suppose we apply a $2$-step attack.
Here, we choose two public inputs such that we slice the domain such that we retrive the secret key depending on the cost measurement.
Given enough $k$, it is possible to retreive the secret key completely however it is not practical as search tree size grows exponentially.
However, if we simply choose $k$ independent public inputs then narrowing down to the secret is very hard.
On the other hand, choosing public inputs based on previous cost observations make it very easy.
For example, for the above example if we choose ${5,6}$ where the costs observed are ${1,2}$ respectively thus the domain is restricted to ${6}$ via ${5,6}$. It is clear that adaptive attacks are very powerful.

The challenge here is to model all possible paths of publich inputs and secret, thus we make them symbolic.
The following is syntax for making variables symbolic in \texttt{Klee}
\begin{verbatim}
// Making the secret symbolic:
klee_make_symbolic(&secret,sizeof(int),"secret");

// Making the public inputs symbolic:
klee_make_symbolic(public_inputs,k * sizeof(int),"public inputs");
\end{verbatim}

Usually symbolic execution is used for synthesis of best side channel attack (we discuss further in outlook section XXX), however here we will only investigate the scalability of \texttt{Klee}.
But it is important to note that in symbolic analysis, which \emph{encodes} all paths in terms of path conditions, it is possible to identify the leakage and thus synthesize best side channel attack.

\subsection{Software: \texttt{Klee} and our experimentation setup}
\label{subsec:softwares}

\href{https://klee.github.io/}{\texttt{Klee}} is a open source symbolic execution tool that runs on top of LLVM infrastructure.
More details are presented in paper XXX.
Generally used to analyse the coverage of code in C/C++ which is inturn compiled into LLVM. 

Docker usage:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{sudo docker run --rm -ti --ulimit='stack=-1:-1' klee/klee}
    \item More information on docker available in \href{http://klee.github.io/releases/docs/v1.3.0/docker/}{github}
\end{enumerate}

Instructions to use for compilation, run and looking at testcases:
\begin{verbatim}
clang -I ../../include -emit-llvm -c -g ./examples/project_proto/symbolic_attack.c
klee -emit-all-errors symbolic_attack.bc 1 6 2
ktest-tool test000018.ktest
\end{verbatim}

\section{Outlook and future work}
\label{sec:futurework}

Symbolic execution of adaptive side channel attack is an earlier stage of bigger problem i.e., the synthesis of optimal side channel attack.
The natural next step is to use the data produced in section XXX (instead of explicit data, a constraint solver can be used to find right values) and synthesising the public inputs with maximum information leakage.

In \texttt{Klee}, we also have different solver options which can be experimented to look at the scalability depending on the underlying solver used.
As we consider small domain and our problem is specific to adaptive side channel attacks, we did not find any change by using different solvers.
However, it is possible that different solvers result in different scalability depending on the problem which needs to be investigated.
